#Lab 1: Penetration Testing Basics

Overview

This lab focused on the basics of penetration testing using Kali Linux.
I practised scanning and enumeration against an intentionally vulnerable virtual machine (Metasploitable2) in a controlled environment.
The goal was to learn how to discover exposed services, test credentials, and record results clearly.

üñ•Ô∏è Environment Details

Host OS: Kali Linux (rolling release at time of lab)

Kernel: Linux 6.x (Kali default)

Platform: VirtualBox VM running on Kali host machine

Target VM: Metasploitable2

Specs: 4 vCPU, 4 GB RAM, 10 GB disk

Tools Used:

Nmap (network scanning and service enumeration)

SSH (service login test)

Network Setup: Host-only or NAT network for isolated testing

Commands Used
1. Port Scanning with Nmap
nmap -sV -p- <target-ip>


Enumerated all open ports and identified service versions.

Found multiple services running such as FTP, SSH, Telnet, Apache, MySQL.

2. Testing SSH Login
ssh msfadmin@<target-ip>


Attempted login with known default credentials:

Username: msfadmin

Password: msfadmin

Successful login confirmed a weak credential vulnerability.

Key Learnings

Reconnaissance first: Nmap results guided which service to target.

Default credentials are dangerous: Metasploitable2 allowed access with msfadmin:msfadmin.

Safe lab practice: Only test against intentionally vulnerable machines, never real systems.

Why Documentation Matters

Provides proof of hands-on penetration testing for my portfolio.

Reinforces a structured approach (scan ‚Üí enumerate ‚Üí test creds ‚Üí document).

Mirrors professional practice in pentest reporting.

Reflection

This lab gave me my first proper foothold in penetration testing.
I learned how to systematically scan, identify a service, and exploit it using weak or default credentials.
It highlighted the importance of password hygiene and why leaving defaults in place is a major risk.
In future labs, I will expand into post-exploitation and privilege escalation once access is gained.
